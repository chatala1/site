Microsoft has announced a policy change that will benefit its cloud computing customers starting in September. They will no longer be required to pay extra fees to access critical data aimed at helping them identify and combat cyberattacks, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the change.

The decision comes in response to concerns expressed by cybersecurity officials, who privately expressed frustration over Microsoft's alleged lack of effort in detecting a Chinese cyber-espionage campaign targeting two-dozen organizations. The campaign came to light last week, with the State Department reporting the cyber activity to Microsoft after detecting it in June.

This recent breach affected the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and State Department officials, highlighting the urgency of addressing cybersecurity issues promptly. One of the victims was a human rights organization that, due to not having a premium software license, was unable to detect the cyber activity, as reported by US cybersecurity firm Volexity, which works closely with the organization.

In combating cyberattacks, logs play a crucial role in understanding and thwarting such activities. Previously, Microsoft charged customers extra for access to these logs as part of its business model. However, the company's decision to now offer these tools for free will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the security posture of its customers worldwide, given the vast amount of data Microsoft handles compared to other security firms.

The free tools provided by Microsoft will empower incident response teams, irrespective of their license level, to conduct more comprehensive investigations, according to Sean Koessel, a vice president at Volexity. He expressed relief at the change, noting that past investigations into customer hacks were often hampered by a lack of crucial data.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, lauded Microsoft's decision. CISA Director Jen Easterly revealed that her agency had been collaborating with Microsoft on this issue for over a year, and she expressed their intent to continue working with technology manufacturers to enhance visibility into their products for all customers.

Overall, Microsoft's decision to provide free access to critical data marks a significant step in fortifying cybersecurity efforts and aiding organizations in their fight against cyber threats.
